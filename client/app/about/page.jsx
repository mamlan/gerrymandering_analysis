        <h3>What is the Fair Representation Act</h3>
        <p>H.R. 7740, also known as the Fair Representation Act, is legislation created to change how the U.S. House of Representatives elections are conducted. The goal of the bill is to ensure a more equitable electoral process, replacing the winner-takes-all system with a ranked-choice voting system and multi-member congressional districts. It seeks to overhaul the electoral system by changing how congressional districts are drawn and how votes are cast.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bill promotes larger congressional districts represented by multiple members, replacing single-member districts.</li>
            <li>It introduces ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates by preference, promoting consensus candidates and reducing negative campaigning.</li>
            <li>The bill requires independent commissions to draw district boundaries, aiming to eliminate gerrymandering.</li>
            <li>The system should make it so that the percentage of votes a party receives is more closely aligned with the number of seats they win in the House.</li>
            <li>The bill targets systemic reforms to address polarization and the lack of fair representation in current congressional elections.</li>
            <li>Independent redistricting commissions would follow strict guidelines to ensure fairness and public accountability in how districts are drawn.</li>
        </ul>
